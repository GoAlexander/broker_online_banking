This program has terrible code and a lot of "dirty hacks", sorry. It was written very very(!) quickly...

What do you need to start this program:

1. Enable Apache POI library
2. Write path to picture in DBOInterface
3. Write new path to excel files

Notes:
The program works with current base good but with another you have to remake some code (in Parsing.java).

Authors of code:
Interface: KhAngelina
Backend: GoAlexander
